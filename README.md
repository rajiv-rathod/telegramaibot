### 2. **Deploy to Vercel**
1. Fork/clone this repository
2. Import to Vercel or use Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel
   ```

### 3. **Configure Environment Variables**
In your Vercel dashboard, go to Settings > Environment Variables and add:

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables locally for the setup script
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token"
export VERCEL_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"

# Run webhook setup
python setup_webhook.py
```

## üéØ Key Architecture Changes for Vercel

### Webhook-Based vs Long-Running Process
- **Original**: Long-running userbot with persistent connections
- **Vercel**: Serverless function responding to Telegram webhooks
- **Benefits**: Auto-scaling, zero maintenance, cost-effective

### Response Flow
```
Telegram ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Vercel Function ‚Üí OpenAI API ‚Üí Response ‚Üí Telegram
```

### Chat State Management
- Conversation history still persists (you may want to add external storage)
- Context tracking maintains Sylvia's personality continuity
- Same human-like behaviors and response processing

## üéÆ Sylvia's Personality Features

- **Interests**: Gaming, pixel art, shawarma, late-night raids

### New Behavioral Patterns
- **Time Awareness**: Different energy levels throughout the day
- **Gaming Focus**: More engaged with gaming/tech topics
- **Emotional Range**: Responds appropriately to user's mood
- **Conversation Memory**: References past interactions naturally

## üîß Configuration Options

### Response Behavior
- **Reply Probability**: How often bot responds in groups (configurable in webhook.py)
- **Gaming Keywords**: Higher engagement with gaming/tech topics
- **Direct Messages**: Always responds in private chats
- **Mentions**: Always responds when bot is mentioned

### Context Management
- `CONTEXT_MSG_LIMIT`: Messages to keep in memory (15)
- `MAX_PROMPT_MSGS`: Messages sent to AI model (10)
- `MAX_RESPONSE_TOKENS`: Maximum response length (200)

## üöÄ Development

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo (showcases human-like features)
python demo.py

# For webhook testing, you'll need to use ngrok or similar
# to expose your local server to Telegram
```

### Webhook Management
```bash
# Set up webhook
python setup_webhook.py

# Remove webhook (for development)
python setup_webhook.py remove
```
